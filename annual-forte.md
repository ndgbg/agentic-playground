Full-Stack Windows Modernization for AWS Transform

## Work Description

In 2025, I drove the end-to-end product definition and launch of Full-Stack Windows Modernization for AWS Transform, a capability that enables customers to modernize their entire Windows application stack — .NET applications, SQL Server databases, and legacy ASP.NET UI — in a single, coordinated workflow. Enterprise customers had consistently told us that modernizing just the .NET application layer wasn't enough; their three-tier architectures were tightly coupled, and piecemeal tools left them stitching the pieces together manually. I took ownership of the working backwards process and prototyping effort to define a solution that addressed this gap, working cross-functionally with the DMS team and the AWS Transform Platform/Foundation team to bring SQL Server-to-Aurora PostgreSQL migration capabilities into the platform.

This was a cross-org initiative, and I took on the coordination goal of aligning priorities and removing blockers across multiple teams. A significant risk I took was advocating for and committing to a multi-agentic AI architecture — multiple specialized agents coordinating schema conversion, stored procedure migration, data migration via DMS, application code refactoring, and deployment validation — all built in a compressed timeline with multiple teams involved. Agentic AI for code transformation was still nascent, the integration surface across teams was large, and delivering a cohesive full-stack experience rather than a collection of disconnected tools required tight coordination under real schedule pressure. I pushed for this approach because the customer need was clear, and shipping anything less would have missed the mark.

The capability launched at re:Invent 2025 as a headline announcement. Since launch, over 25 customers are actively using the service with more than 80 modernization jobs completed, validating the product-market fit and the full-stack approach. Customers like Teamfront have modernized 800,000 lines of code in just two weeks — work that previously would have taken months — demonstrating the 5x acceleration we set out to deliver. Customers including Air Canada, Experian, Thomson Reuters, and Verisk are now using AWS Transform, and the full-stack Windows modernization capabilities have expanded the addressable market to the massive installed base of SQL Server workloads. The feature is offered at no additional charge, making it a high-value on-ramp for customers looking to reduce operating costs by up to 70% by moving off costly SQL Server licenses. This launch taught me a great deal about driving cross-org alignment under ambiguity, and reinforced that when the customer need is strong enough, it's worth taking the risk to deliver the right solution rather than the safe one.

Additionally, I improved the .NET assessments experience by decoupling discovery from assessment, allowing customers to get assessment results faster without waiting for the full discovery process to complete. This reduced time-to-insight and made it easier for customers to evaluate their modernization readiness and start planning sooner.

In 2026, I helped define PAT-based access for AWS Transform, enabling more flexible and secure authentication for customers integrating with the platform. I also prototyped auto transform mode in ATX, laying the groundwork for a hands-off modernization experience where customers can kick off end-to-end transformations with minimal manual intervention.
